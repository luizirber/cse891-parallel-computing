<!-- Abstract: Give an overview of the final project and identify the team members. This (roughly) 1
page document is expected to answer the following questions:
- What is the problem and why is parallel processing necessary to solve it? Try to describe the
benefits that an efficient parallel implementation would have on researchers and practitioners
in the field.
- What is the state of the art in terms of the existing solutions? Are you planning to parallelize
a sequential code? or port an existing parallel implementation to a different platform (a
multi-core CPU, a many-core/GPU accelerator)? or work on characterizing and improving
the performance of an existing parallel application? Are there any similar efforts reported in
the literature?
- What are the tools and libraries that you are planning to use? OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, BLAS,
LAPACK, etc.? What is the scale of the problems that you are aiming to solve?
- How would you evaluate the success of your project? Comparison to an existing solution is
certainly one way to do it. If thatâ€™s not possible, performance analysis in terms of processing
speed and/or scalability could be complementary alternatives.
- Finally, elaborate on the division of work among team members. Each team member is
expected to contribute equally to the project. -->
